## Write Effective Commit Messages

Clear, concise, and meaningful commit messages help maintain a readable history of changes. Follow these guidelines for writing commit messages:

- **Use present tense**: Commit messages should describe what *this commit does*, not what *it did* (e.g., "Fix bug in validation logic" rather than "Fixed bug").
- **Be descriptive, but concise**: Summarize what you changed and why in a single line if possible. If more detail is needed, provide additional explanation in the body of the message.

### Example Commit Message:
```
Fix user authentication issue after password reset

- Users were unable to log in after resetting their password due to a session mismatch.
- Added a check to synchronize the session after a password reset.
```

### Create Meaningful Pull Request Titles and Descriptions

When submitting a pull request (PR), it's important to make the title and description clear and easy to understand. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

### Pull Request Title:
- **Be specific**: Clearly describe what the pull request accomplishes. 
- **Use imperative mood**: Like with commit messages, use the present tense (e.g., "Add new login screen" instead of "Added new login screen").

### Example PR Title:
```
Fix user authentication issue after password reset
```

### Pull Request Description:
Provide a detailed explanation of the following in your PR description:
- **What**: A brief overview of the change you made.
- **Why**: Explain why this change is necessary.
- **How**: If applicable, provide context on how you implemented the change.

### Example PR Description:
```
## What:
This pull request fixes an issue where users were unable to log in after resetting their password.

## Why:
Users reported issues with authentication after password reset. This fix ensures the session is synchronized post-reset.

## How:
Added logic to check the session after a password reset and synchronize it with the new user credentials.
```

## Best Practices
- **Code Quality**: Ensure code is readable, well-documented, and follows project conventions.
- **Testing**: Test your changes locally before submitting a PR.
- **Security**: Avoid hardcoded credentials or sensitive information in commits.
- **Communication**: Be responsive to feedback on PRs and make necessary changes promptly.

## Submitting a Video Demonstration
To help maintainers understand your changes, submit a short video showcasing the new feature or bug fix:
- Record a short demo.
- Upload the video and share a link in the PR description.

## Reporting Issues
